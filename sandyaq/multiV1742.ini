# Individual Settings 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following setting are usually applied on channel by channel
# basis; however, you can put them also in the [COMMON] section in
# order to apply them to all the channels.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# ENABLE_INPUT: enable/disable one channel (or one group in the case of the Mod 740 and Mod 742)
# options: YES, NO

# DC_OFFSET: DC offset adjust (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# For model 740 and 742* the DC offset adjust is the same for all channel in the group
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp to 0 (negative signals)*
# +50: analog input dynamic range = 0 to +Vpp (positive signals)*
# 0:   analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)*
# options: -50.0 to 50.0  (floating point)
#*NOTE: Ranges are different for 742 Model.....see GRP_CH_DC_OFFSET description

# GRP_CH_DC_OFFSET dc_0, dc_1, dc_2, dc_3, dc_4, dc_5, dc_6, dc_7
# Available only for model 742, allows to set different DC offset adjust for each channel (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -3Vpp/2 to -Vpp/2 (max negative dynamic)
# +50: analog input dynamic range = +Vpp/2 to +3Vpp/2 (max positive dynamic)
# 0: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)
# options: -50.0 to 50.0  (floating point)

# TRIGGER_THRESHOLD: threshold for the channel auto trigger (ADC counts)
# options 0 to 2^N-1 (N=Number of bit of the ADC)

# CHANNEL_TRIGGER: channel auto trigger settings. When enabled, the ch. auto trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT

# GROUP_TRG_ENABLE_MASK: this option is used only for the Models x740. These models have the
# channels grouped 8 by 8; one group of 8 channels has a common trigger that is generated as
# the OR of the self trigger of the channels in the group that are enabled by this mask.
# options: 0 to FF

#NOTE: When synchronizing digitizers, if you want to have the channel triggers participate in the global trigger, PLEASE set ACQUISITON_AND_TRGOUT!!!!!
